States are main game states, like "rooms" per se. Substates are not exactly like that, 
they would be more like the gameover state and such, that doesn't override the entire game.

Additional meta files are related to controls and variables or information. Those are neither states 
nor substates, but are still important for information and such.

lmao look at me being all professiona- oh shit I ruined it
