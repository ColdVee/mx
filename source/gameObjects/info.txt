Hey, Shubs again. Just a little note in the source code, whenever you add stuff in here, stuff in the gameObjects folder will be loaded
universally in the playState and such, so everything you want specifically for certain stages and such should be added in the EXCLUDE folder
within this folder. Within that folder you'll find more assortments of folders for things that should be loaded in separately.
