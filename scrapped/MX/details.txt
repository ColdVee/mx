MX was originally going to have a song in the mod, but it got scrapped for multiple reasons.

His song was meant to be in 2 parts, initially against Lucas while hiding from MX
But after being spotted, it'd become a chase sequence, playing as both characters against MX.

While his song never got finished, all the assets made for him are provided in this folder, in case anyone wants to complete it themselves.
